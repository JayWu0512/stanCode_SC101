# stanCode_SC101: Programming Abstraction

##  About Me

In May 2023, I decided to pursue a career in programming, exploring the integration between the fields of accounting and programming, and I am currently navigating this path.

##  My Journey

This repo is all about my coding adventure and the progress I've made so far. Within, I've tackled seven assignments, each honing my abilities in Fundamental Programming Logic, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples), Web Crawling via BeautifulSoup, Recursion, and Linked Lists.

### ðŸ‘€ Assignments at a Glance:

- [Assignment 0](SC101Assignment0): Basic implementation on **Fundamental Programming Logic** - Variables, Console Interaction, Loops, and Expressions
- [Assignment 1](SC101Assignment1): Basic implementation on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Bouncing Ball
- [Assignment 2](SC101Assignment2): Advanced application on **Object-Oriented Programming** - Breakout Game
- [Assignment 3](SC101Assignment3): Implementation using **Data Structure (list, dict, tuple)** - Self-crafted PhotoShop
- [Assignment 4](SC101Assignment4): Implementation combining **Data Structures with a Web Crawler** (BeautifulSoup) - Search for Baby Names
- [Assignment 5](SC101Assignment5): Implementation of **Recursion** in algorithms - Search for Anagrams
- [Assignment 6](SC101Assignment6): Implementation of **Data Structures and Linked Lists** - LC212: Boggle Game

## ðŸ“– About stanCode SC101

At the heart of my learning journey is stanCode, a brainchild of Stanford MSc. grad Jerry, dedicated to delivering Stanford-grade CS education to students across disciplines in Taiwan. stanCode 101, drawing inspiration from Stanfordâ€™s CS106B, lays a solid groundwork in programming.
